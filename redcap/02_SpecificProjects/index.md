# 2. REDCap Entry for Specific B-RAD Lab Projects/Studies

## Updating Participant ID's after Participation
For any studies attempted/completed that have survey measures in a different project, first navigate to that project and enter its own Record Status Dashboard. 

For any studies with survey links that get sent to participants, you cannot name them yourself because auto-naming is force-enabled. You must click ![Auto-Naming ID Creation Box](/assets/redcap_tutorial/REDCAP_newRecord-Auto.png) instead and rename AFTER inputting data to save it.  

#### Renaming Participant IDs
To rename a record ID, you must have permissions first. Click on the newly created ID that needs to be renamed, and under Choose action for record, click rename record and input the correct participant ID. ![REDCap Renaming Area](/assets/redcap_tutorial/REDCap_renaming.png)

    
## Participant Data Entry - Project Specific
In the participant's newly created ID for the project of interest, input any/all participant survey measures information. Some instruments/survey measures in REDCap have specific instructions pertaining to the study (i.e, Who took this survey? or “Session Number”), so pay special attention when inputting data.  

If participants are missing data and the response says “REQUIRED”, when trying to Save & Exit, you can click ANY option. 

1. “Okay” takes you back to the survey, and after trying again to leave it will save. 
2. “Ignore and leave record” takes you to a weird-looking dashboard, but all you need to do is navigate to record status dashboard again to fix this. 
3. “Ignore and go to next form” takes you to the next survey form to complete. If there are no surveys after, you can only select “Okay” or “Ignore and leave record”
