# 1. REDCap Data Entry - B-RAD Main (II)

## Participant Identifiers in REDCap
Participant Identifiers in REDCap should be created during scheduling and before they come in. We want to reduce the amount of blank/unused ID’s as much as possible. 

Under the B-RAD Main (II) project in REDCap, either FIND or CREATE an ID for the participant in question. If you’re unsure that the participant is in our system, navigate on the side bar to Reports > 10) ID PHI and type in the participant’s name. If their name does not come up, create an ID. 

All participant identifiers will need to be in B-RAD Main (II) project, regardless of other project data being housed outside of B-RAD Main (II) or not. For example, the SCWB Study has 3 projects for housing data, but all participants within the SCWB project are also within B-RAD Main (II). We use this as a quick reference for ALL participants, regardless of project. These abstraction measures were started around May 2024 with the inception of the SCWB study, and these updated project procedures have stayed with multiple additional projects since then (Autistic Friendships, Rooster Tales, Mind Matters). 

## Creating Participant Identifiers in REDCap
In the B-RAD Main (II) project, navigate to the Record Status Dashboard. This is where you can create IDs and manage instruments (survey measures) in REDCap. ALL previous B-RAD participants can be viewed and searched through the Record Status Dashboard. 

In the small box between Dashboard settings and the table display, type in the new participant ID into the following box: ![ID Creation Box](/assets/redcap_tutorial/REDCap_newRecord.png) and click Create. 

If you are unsure of what the next ID is, check the last item in Displayed records ![Displayed Records Example](/assets/redcap_tutorial/REDCap_displayedRecords.png) 
- *Ex., through “1816” means the ID you would type in is “1817”.*

Once the ID is created, it should say “NEW B-RAD ID IDXX” with blank data collection instruments. ![Example B-RAD ID](/assets/redcap_tutorial/REDCap_newID.png) 

In B-RAD Main, regardless of project, three items should always be completed for EVERY participant.  

1. Subject demographics/contact (PHI)
2. Subject demographics (de-ID) 
3. Experimental tasks 

**If you have any information you can provide about this participant (even if they have not come in yet), place it in Subject demographics/contact (PHI).**

*Any information needs to be there, even if as a placeholder, or else the ID will not be logged/saved!*

## Updating Participant ID's after Participation
After the participant has attempted/completed experimental tasks or measures and you want to input their data into the REDCap databases, ensure the following are checked off/completed in the B-RAD Main (II) Project FIRST: 

#### Subject demographics/contact (PHI)
*Information from the contact form that should be completed by every new participant.*
Especially important information:  
1. Gender Identity 
2. Age/Date of Birth 
3. Race 
4. Ethnicity
5. Psychiatric questions/Dx

#### Subject demographics (de-ID)
*logs the visit number based on Date of Visit (when they came in for experimental tasks and/or completed measures)*

#### Experimental tasks
*Logs important visit information, including:*
1. IRB/Study of interest 
2. Date of visit (should match de-ID!) 
3. Any personnel involved
4. Compensation methods 
5. Experimental methods 
6. Validity notes* 
7. Tasks completed (+ status) 

*Validity is assessed for measures and experimental tasks based on the following criteria: 
1. No validity concerns
*EXPLANATION HERE*
2. Questionable validity but completed measure
*EXPLANATION HERE*
3. Invalid or could not complete
*EXPLANATION HERE* Did not finish experimental tasks
4. Did not attempt to measure
